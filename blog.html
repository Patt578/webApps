  <h2 class="blogTitle">Java Collections API</h2>
  <p class="info">Today I finished researching concepts surrounding Java's built in Collections Library, this includes the Map interface, sets, and of course all kinds of Lists which I've been using for some time now.</p>My current goal now is to master my knowledge of the library by making a simple text adventure game that uses Maps as a framework for locations and exits within the game. As well as use sets to group together similar type monsters. Since Maps are built with keys assigned to values which is perfect for locations and exits. And then regarding sets, this will allow me to group Monster objects in no order for random spawns upon entering a room.<p>

<h2 class="blogTitle">JavaFX </h2>
<p class="info">This week has been a little slow, as I've been recently feeling a little under the weather. However, I'm very excited to begin work on understanding JavaFX and begin building more user friendly Java Applications! There are a lot of topics to cover and I'll briefly list below what I'm going to cover of the next week.
   <p>
     <b>JavaFX Research</b>
     <ul>
       <li>Layouts</li>
        <li>FXml</li>
        <li>Controls</li>
        <li>Buttons & Checkboxes</li>
        <li>Event Handlers</li>
     </ul>
     <p>These topics are on the way to being mastered and it really is exciting! Once I feel confident enough with JavaFX I'll move on to making some simple 2D games with it.</p>

  <h2 class="blogTitle">Web Development</h2>
  <p class="info">Over the last few weeks I've been working in two main areas of Web Developing, those being Bootstrap and now working more to refine my Javascript skills. I'm just now starting to understand of powerful of a tool Javascript is and I'm very excited to start digging deeper and learning more useful APi's for Javascript. </p>
  <p>
The elements of Bootstrap that I've been learning are just the basic right now, but as expected bootstrap has been a great tool in designing beautiful websites. Focus areas of bootstrap have been Navbars, Fonts, and general learning of the syntax used. I just recently added a jumbotron text field to the home page of the website with a simple button leading to the about section.

  <h2 class="blogTitle">Python</h2>
  <p class = "info">This is a soon to be updated section for my progress in Python. Currently however most of my efforts have been focused on improving my Java and Web Development skills. I'll be sure to update this soon when I start to tackle more important Python concepts! :)</p>
